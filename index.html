        The Economics Department at Emory University is happy to announce “Econometrics in Emory: Causal Inference with Panel Data.”
         <span style="color: #b8860b; font-weight: 800;">Econometrics in Emory</span> is a new iniative that aims to bring together econometricians in academia and industry to discuss
        the latest developments in Econometrics and related fields. Each year, the workshop will focus on a specific theme, with the
        goal of fostering a community of researchers interested in the same topics. This year, the workshop will focus on Causal Inference
        with Panel Data.
    </p>
    <p>
        A unique feature of the Econometrics in Emory workshop is the <span style="color: #b8860b; font-weight: 800;">connection between academia and industry.</span> The workshop will feature
        presentations from leading researchers in academia, as well as practitioners from industry. This will provide a unique opportunity
        for participants to learn about the latest research in the field, as well as how it is being applied in practice. Our goal is to
        foster a rich exchange of ideas and experiences, and bridge the gap between academia and industry. 
    </p>
    
    <h2>Speakers</h2>
