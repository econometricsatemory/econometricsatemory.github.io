        The Economics Department at Emory University is happy to announce “Econometrics in Emory: Causal Inference with Panel Data.”
         <span style="color: #b8860b; font-weight: 900;">Econometrics in Emory</span> is a new iniative that aims to bring together econometricians in academia and industry to discuss
        the latest developments in Econometrics and related fields. Each year, the workshop will focus on a specific theme, with the
        goal of fostering a community of researchers interested in the same topics. This year, the workshop will focus on Causal Inference
        with Panel Data.
    </p>
    <p>
        A unique feature of the Econometrics in Emory workshop is the connection between academia and industry. The workshop will feature
        presentations from leading researchers in academia, as well as practitioners from industry. This will provide a unique opportunity
        for participants to learn about the latest research in the field, as well as how it is being applied in practice. This will allow for
        a rich exchange of ideas and experiences, and will help bridge the gap between academia and industry. 
    </p>
    
    <h2>Speakers</h2>
